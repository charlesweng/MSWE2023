Systems Used
============
Node Version: v16.17.1
Browser: Firefox 106.0
Operating System: macOS Monterey Version 12.5
Architecture: ARM-based

React Features Used
===================
I babel to compile JSX (javascript xml) into pure javascript. The main React elements I used are React components and React's state management system with setState. I also used a lifecycle method in React called shouldComponentUpdate to check if a new web page bookmark is added to the UI.

How to Test The Webserver
=========================
Run `npm install`
Run `npx babel main.jsx --out-file main.js`
Run `mv main.js public`
Run `npm start`
Open browser and type `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` in the URL bar
Type stuff in the input bar and submit
